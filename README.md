# ludum-dare-34
My entry for the Ludum Dare 34 game jam. The game jam's theme was "Two Button Controls".

Built using the Unity game engine (version: 5.2.2f1)

Entry page is [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=29419).

Download compiled game [here](https://hobblygobbly.itch.io/last-ditch-voyage-ludum-dare-34-jam-game).

## Description:

Explore a randomly generated planetary system with random event encounters and a very simple two-button turn-based combat system. Can be replayed multiple times for different encounters. 

The balance may not be perfect all the time but you can spend endless hours tuning balance but I have run out of time for the jam (have things to tend to IRL!) 

Minimum resolution: 1024x768 

## How To Play

Space - Center on ship 

Mouse Left Click - Select object 

Mouse Wheel - Zoom in and out 

Escape - Pause/Exit Menu 

---

Fuel - Uses 1 fuel every 1 second you're moving, having no fuel is a losing condition 

Ordnance - Uses 1 for every time your ship fires upon the enem 

Food - Uses 1 food every 2 seconds you are moving, having no food is a losing condition 

Repair Equipment - Used for repairing shield, armor and hull when you resupply. 

---

Click "REGEN" to procedurally regenerate the planetary system (orbital paths, resources etc).

Click "EXPLORE" to discover resources on planet. 

Click "RESUPPLY" when at a discovered planet to resupply from it and repair. 


Objective: Discover all the planets, don't run out of resources, and don't be destroyed from enemy encounters (if you encounter them!)
